# uBooNECRTSlowMon
MicroBooNE's Cosmic Ray Tagger Slow Control Monitor Interface Script

## Installation

As this is meant to run on the CRT machines, I highly recommend an installation from source.

It is important that this is run with the user that will be deploying the script. For instance, if `uboonepro` is the production user on the machine, then the package needs to be installed by uboonepro.
